He goes on to explain what he's doing\nthere -- what he's studying, what he's learned,\nwho he's spoken with. The first major insight\nis into the Western misrepresentation of the\nShaman. He identifies them as, primarily,\nintermediaries between the human and non-human.\nThe power and role Shamans associate with\nthe non-human has been, allegedly, misassociated\nwith the \"supernatural\" when, in fact, it is\ncompletely natural. Abrams cites the cause of\nthis as the expectations of (Protestant)\nChristian missionaries doing early work and\nmaking first substantial contact and\ninterpretation. An example is given of the\nculture's awareness of the non-human where\na native sets out rice as an offering to the\n\"spirits of the forest\" - in fact, the local ant colonies.\nEssentially, Abrams addresses the differences\nbetween the modern western image of the self\nand nature and the traditional Eastern\nperspective. In this comparison he proposes that\nthe various evils and ills afflicting our civilization\nare due to imbalance and improper relationship\nwith the non-human. I'm curious if there\nis some non-relative metric by which you can\nrate these symptoms? I wouldn't expect to\nuse life span.
